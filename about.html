                            Hi everyone! My name is Xavier and I’m 1 of BRIC’s co-founders alongside Sarah and will be serving as 1 of the Co-Presidents. 
                            I’m currently in my 3rd year of the BSc Honors Neuroscience program and am in Dr. Deena Hamza’s lab where we are working on 
                            synthesizing a transdisciplinary framework that addresses the ecology of change. Some things I like to do in my spare time 
                            include listening to music and going to concerts, keeping up with pro sports, going hiking in Jasper or Kananaskis, hanging 
                            out with my dog Percy, and reading. A fun fact about me is that I was born in the Philippines and didn’t move to Canada until I was 3!

                            Hi guys! I’m Sarah and I’m ½ of the president duo this year. We’re very excited to get things rolling and we have a fantastic executive team for our inaugural year. I’m currently going into my third year in the Honours Immunology and Infection program. I’m also currently in the Brain Power Lab (under my supervisor, Dr. Power), where I’ve spent this past summer looking at proinflammatory cell death in a glioma cell line. When I’m not studying or in the lab, I love spending time with friends and reading (trying to read classics right now). As for a fun fact, I grew up on a farm in southern Alberta & love home visiting as often as I can!
